Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, 
Over many a quaint and curious journal of forgotten science—
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my laboratory door.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my laboratory door—
Only this and nothing more.”

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak Systems Biology Journal Club;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me — filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my laboratory door—
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my laboratory door;—
This it is and nothing more.”


Presently my pipetting skills grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was genome mapping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my laboratory door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—
Darkness there and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there excited, terrified,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—
Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the laboratory turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
’Tis the wind and nothing more!”

Open here I flung the transcription factor, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my laboratory door—
Perched upon a bust of Jun Allard just above my laboratory door—
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this luminescent avian beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”

It will be so hot this weekend!
